## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A common occurence during table top games, like DND, that rely heavily on die rolls is players complaining that the die is biased, i.e. one outcome is more likely than others. The DND Dice Checker is an app that will evaluate bias in gaming die. In order to do this, the app will allow users to create their own profiles, store information about dice sets and individual die, and test individual die for for bias. The test for die bias uses a Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test.
